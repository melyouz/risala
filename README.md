# Risala

gRPC based Message Broker written in Go for self learning purpose.

## Running Locally

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Install Go v1.23**  
   Ensure that Go v1.23 is installed. You can download it from [go.dev](https://go.dev/).

2. **Run the Broker**  
   Start the broker with sample data by navigating to the project directory and running:

   ```bash
   cd broker && make run WITH_SAMPLE_DATA=1
   ```

3. **Run the Producer**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the producer (adjust EVENTS_COUNT to control the number of generated events):
   ```bash
   cd producer && make run EVENTS_COUNT=1000
   ```

4. **Run the consumer**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the consumer:
   ```bash
   cd consumer && make run
   ```

> Note: You can run multiple instances of Producers and Consumers.

> UI: Currently, there is no available UI.
